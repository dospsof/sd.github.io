        <h1>My creature</h1>
        
        <p>My<em></em> creature is magical! It can fly, walk, speak, sleep - it snores very loudly at night! It is nearly as a human being.. The creature is so <strong> cute</strong>. "The BEST creature ever" The creature is awesome because it <strong> listens </strong> to you. It does whatever  <em> you</em> want! It really is the best creature <em>ever! </em>
